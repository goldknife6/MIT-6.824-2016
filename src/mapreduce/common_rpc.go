// Field names must start with capital letters, otherwise RPC will break.

// DoJobArgs holds the arguments that are passed to a worker when a job is
// scheduled on it.
type DoJobArgs struct {
	JobName   string
	File      string   // the file to process
	Phase     jobPhase // are we in mapPhase or reducePhase?
	JobNumber int      // this job's index in the current phase

	// NumOtherPhase is the total number of jobs in other phase; mappers
	// need this to compute the number of output bins, and reducers needs
	// this to know how many input files to collect.
	NumOtherPhase int

// ShutdownReply is the response to a WorkerShutdown.
// It holds the number of jobs this worker has processed since it was started.

// call() sends an RPC to the rpcname handler on server srv
// with arguments args, waits for the reply, and leaves the
// reply in reply. the reply argument should be the address
// of a reply structure.
//
// call() returns true if the server responded, and false
// if call() was not able to contact the server. in particular,
// reply's contents are valid if and only if call() returned true.
//
// you should assume that call() will time out and return an
// error after a while if it doesn't get a reply from the server.
//
// please use call() to send all RPCs, in master.go, mapreduce.go,
// and worker.go.  please don't change this function.
